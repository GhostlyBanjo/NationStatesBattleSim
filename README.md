# NationStatesBattleSim
NationStates Battle Simulator is a roleplaying supplement and Battle Simulator for Nation States.  It's designed to take input from the user for different factors of battle: Force Count, Morale, Technology, Training, Combat Experience, Logistics, and Intel, and simulate the outcome of a skirmish to be roleplayed out after.  This allows for constructive roleplay, as the outcome of the battle isn't decided by story arc alone.  



# How to use
There are many, many factors to war.  Often in roleplaying, it's difficult to fairly decide the outcome of a battle.  
Enter me, with an idea.  The program is packaged in an executable JAR, so just run it like anything else. The Jar is in the root directory.
The program calculates different factors, physical force count, troop morale, level of technology, the level of training, troop combat experience, logistics, intel, and supplies.  Enter the two sets of values for each team, then hit Run Simulation.  

#Calculating your Forces
This doesn't mean your total entire military.  Simply put, it's how many troops you're throwing at the specific battle.
#Calculating Morale
Your troops need to have hope.  If they've been on a constant losing streak, they'll be less likely to fight their best.  Each division/squad/etc starts at 100 Morale.  With each loss, subtract 10.  With each victory, add 10.  

#Calculating everything else
Everything else is treated on a scale of 1-10.  Now, before you go and ask questions, pay attention.  I made this for people who awant to act like adults for roleplaying.  Quantifying arbitrary values is hard, so what I'll due it describe what each parameter does.  It's up to ou and your enemy to decide the actual values.


Technology:
This value is how technologically advanced your country is.  Here's a few examples:

WWII:
Russia - Tech 3
'Murica - Tech 7
Britain - Tech 5
Germany - Tech 9


Medieval:
England - Tech 7
Chinese - Tech 9
Vikings - Tech 2

Hope that makes sense

Training Rating:
This value is how well trained your fighting force is.  If your soldiers are hyper-elite, near-super humans that have undergone years of training, they'll be higher on the scale than a bunch of kids thrown into battle.

Combat Experience:
This value is similar to the training value, but vastly different.  This value relies on hoe battle-hardened your forces are.  Nations with more wars in their history should have higher values, while newer nations would have lower.


Logistics:
This value is the ability for the non-combat personnel's ability to move supplies to and from the front line.  

Intel:
How much the intelligence the nation has over the other.  If one country has been flying spy planes over the other for years, they'd have the higher value.  Can also be measured by how much crtical information you know about the enemy fo the battlefield.

Home Team Advantage:
Fighting on your home soil gives you an advantage.  


#Reading the Output
Now, battles are dynamic.  This is shown in the simulator by the intermittent outcome screen, then "Continue?/Retreat?" dialouges.  If you're losing too many forces, you can leave.  

As I've been reading it, the Score value is based on per hour of fighting, so each intermittent "Win" is basically dominating the fight for that one hour.

#FAQ

Q: Why can't I use the Nation States stats?

A: The reason the NS values aren't compatible with this version is that Nation States is a country simulator,  not a military simulator.  Almost all of the values on Nation States have nothing to do militaries, which is why it's set up as such.  Maybe later, a version will be release that has integration with the NS stats, but for now, this is a roleplaying supplement, not an extension of NationStates itself.
