# NationStatesBattleSim
A Battle Simulator for Nation States roleplay



# How to use
There are many, many factors to war.  Often in roleplaying, it's difficult to fairly decide the outcome of a battle.  
Enter me, with an idea.  The program is packaged in an executable JAR, so just run it like anything else. The Jar is in the root directory.
The program calculates different factors, physical force count, troop morale, level of technology, the level of training, troop combat experience, logistics, intel, and supplies.  Enter the two sets of values for each team, then hit Run Simulation.  

#Calculating your Forces
This doesn't mean your total entire military.  Simply put, it's how many troops you're throwing at the specific battle.
#Calculating Morale
Your troops need to have hope.  If they've been on a constant losing streak, they'll be less likely to fight their best.
